1. extract text 
2. for left and right 2 arrays 
3. finding elements 1st to 2nd .... 
4. subtracting and pop them from array 
5. make a new array of substituted elements 
6. sum of array 
7. result

%% alternative approach 
sort two arrays 
same index subtract 
resultant in an new array 
summation = target


=> part two 
take 2 arrays 
compare 1 elements appearance in another 
element * appearance = ans 
ans array += target
