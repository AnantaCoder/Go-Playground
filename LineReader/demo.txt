A Tree
A tree is a symbol of life and strength. It stands tall with roots deep in the ground, providing shelter to birds and shade to people. Its green leaves purify the air, and its fruits feed countless creatures. Trees change with the seasonsâ€”blossoming in spring, offering cool shade in summer, shedding leaves in autumn, and standing bare yet proud in winter. A tree teaches patience and resilience. It grows silently but steadily, reminding us of nature's quiet power. Without trees, life on Earth would not be possible. Protecting them is our duty for a better, greener future.
